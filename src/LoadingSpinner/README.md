# Usage

The `LoadingSpinner` should be used whenever the content of a page or a section of a page takes more than half a second to load.

To help the user understand which information is loading, the dimmed layer should cover only the loading section and the spinner should be positioned at its center.

# Variants

## Color
The loading spinner and the message should have the same color of the text below.

## Message
If the content is taking a long time to load, you should add a message to reassure the user there is no error and possibly to explain what is happening:
