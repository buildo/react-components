The short content should be a summary of the long content. Remember the following:
- do not arbitrarily cut the content in the short version, try to provide a summary with the most relevant information
- it's ok to change the layout between the short and long version, to optimize how information is presented
- this is not an overflow component, the content should be semantically the same but summarized in the short version, with only the most relevant information presented
